<h1 class="center">The Story</h1>
<img src="../Media/Ball.gif" alt="Black Ball" style="width:200px;height:200px;" class="imgcent">
<p class="center">You, the Player, are a member of the Ball Containment Foundation, and are tasked with retrieving some balls from [REDACTED], Alaska. The location in question is a small, narrow cave system where several sightings of randomly-appearing balls have been reported. You have been dispatched to properly contain the balls. However, it will be much more difficult than you thought...</p> 
<h1 class="center">How to Play</h1>
<p class="center">There are 2 players, but you can play as one. Before you do that, make sure you remember that there are 2 players, which are codenamed Red and Blue. Red uses WASD controls and Blue uses arrow keys. You can play as both of them or either one. Your goal is to get as high of a score as possible. You can keep track of your score at the bottom of the screen. To score a goal, you need to knock the ball to the bottom of the map, where there's a goal. There are many obstacles in your way, such as boxes that deduct from your score, stalagtites that destroy balls and boxes, and a turret that shoots at you and tries to kill you. You can deal with this by holding down shift, which blocks the bullets from hitting you. You have a health meter at the bottom of your screen, and you start out with 4 lives. By the way, if you fall into the goal, you lose a point. Have fun!</p>
