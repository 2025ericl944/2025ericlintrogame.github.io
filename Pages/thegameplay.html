<h1 class="center">On Start</h1>
<p class="center">On the booting up of the game, some text will appear on the screen telling you about the Players. You can play as either Red or Blue. The Blue block uses WASD controls (A is left, D is right, W is to jump, and S is to go through Jump-Thru Platforms) and the Red Block uses arrow keys, which are pretty obvious to play with. Press "1" to play as Blue and "2" to play as Red. You can also choose to play as both of them or play with two poeple. You can then press "Enter" to remove the text from your screen.</p> 
<h1 class="center">Gameplay</h1>
<p class="center">Now, onto the gameplay. On the starting of the game, a turret will aim and fire at you. I haven't figured out how to stop it from firing until you click enter to make the text disappear, so you'll just have to hold down "Shift" until you're done reading. You start out with 4 health and only take damage from the turrets, thank goodness. Next, you might notice there are balls that you can interact with all over the stage, along with a score display in the HUD next to the Health. Your goal is to push the ball over to the goal at the bottom of the screen. Luckily, you can move the balls with a simple push. The stage has a wrap-around effect so that when you go through one edge of the map you come out of the opposite, similar to Pac-Man. You can use this to you advantage so that you can push a ball into one side and it comes out th eother and falls to the goal. Each ball has different properties, such as bounciness and slipperyness. Next, there's boxes with similar properties to the balls except they're super-slippery. Don't get these in the goal as they deduct one from your score. What you want to do is avoid them at all costs if you're doing a perfect run to 100 (NoBox% Speedrun). Now for the turret. You can parry bullets by holding down shift, so you can just run around holding down shift to make the turret obsolete, but if you want challenge, you can try and time your Shift presses. Then, there are a bunch of spikes on the bottom of the platforms you stand on. These spikes will destroy balls or boxes that collide with them, but they don't harm players. Still, they could impede your progress, especially when you're with the super-bouncy ball. Now last but not least, scoring. If a player or a box falls into the goal, you will lose one point from your score. Pushing balls into the goal will give 1 point, and you can push multiple balls at once into the goal for a huge boost. Nothing happens when your score goes below 0, but when your Health reaches 0, the entire layout resets. That was it for the gameplay, and now you can go play the game properly. Good luck!</p>
