<h1 class="center">Descrption and Functions</h1>
<p class="center">This giant box is the entire level, but you can only view wherever the players are. This is due to code, but we're not here to talk about that. The dotted line is the viewport, or what you can see.</p>
<h2 class="center">The Players</h2>
<p class="center">In it, to the left, there is a Red block and a Blue block. Those are the players.</p>
<h2 class="center">The Objects and Threats</h2>
<p class="center">The black circles laying around everywhere are the balls, and you're supposed to get them to the goal, which is the green bar at the bottom of the layout. The gigantic structures laying around are the platforms that you can stand on, but that's pretty obvious. The brown platforms are jump-thru, meaning you can jump up through and onto them or go through and under it. At the bottom of the massive non-jump-thru platforms are spikes. These will destroy the balls and boxes upon touching them. The players are safe, though. What you really have to watch out for is the yellow box near the top of the layout. That is the turret, and it will attempt to destroy the players. The tiny bullets are loaded away from the layout so that they don't get in the way. Also away from the layout is a pink ball. That is the cool effect that displays when you block a bullet from the turret.</p>
<h2 class="center">The HUD</h2>
<p class="center">Of course, there's also the UI, which is plastered to the same position on the viewport. There is placeholder text there because I thought it was funny for some reason. Lastly, there's the text that appears upon booting up the game. It just floats there.</p>
